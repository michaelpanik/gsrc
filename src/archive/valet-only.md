about: |
    Totally funked up.
    In a dorm room on campus at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, high school friends Austin Snow (bass) and Andrew Panik (keys/vocals) found Dallas native Reese Ponce-Massey (drums) after he wandered into the room looking for food, and refused to leave. Valet Only was born. Eli Ponder-Twardy (trombone) rounds out the sound with his eclectic jazz influence. Their gonzo performance style spans everything from snake-handling Pentacostal church services to intimate coffee shop balladeers and everything in between. Outside of the core four, the band frequently collaborates with a brash of brass- and woodwind instrumentalists.
